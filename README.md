# Bubble-Sort

Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements in the string, from left to right, switching their positions if they are out of order. The algorithm then repeats this process until it can run through the entire string and find no two elements that need to be swapped.

In this article, we will discuss the Bubble sort Algorithm. The working procedure of bubble sort is simplest. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face bubble sort as a question in their examinations. So, it is important to discuss the topic.

Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.

Although it is simple to use, it is primarily used as an educational tool because the performance of bubble sort is poor in the real world. It is not suitable for large data sets. The average and worst-case complexity of Bubble sort is O(n2), where n is a number of items.

Bubble short is majorly used where -

complexity does not matter simple and shortcode is preferred
